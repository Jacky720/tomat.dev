servile dog wheezes and pants and stumbles to bring it to you. Do the 
same before a cat, and he will eye you with coolly polite and somewhat 
bored amusement. And just as inferior people prefer the inferior animal 
which scampers excitedly because someone else wants something, so do 
superior people respect the superior animal which lives its own life and
 knows that the puerile stick-throwings of alien bipeds are none of its 
business and beneath its notice. The dog barks and begs and tumbles to 
amuse you when you crack the whip. That pleases a meekness-loving 
peasant who relishes a stimulus to his self importance. The cat, on the 
other hand, charms you into playing for its benefit when it wishes to be
 amused; making you rush about the room with a paper on a string when it
 feels like exercise, but refusing all your attempts to make it play 
when it is not in the humour. That is personality and individuality and 
self-respect -- the calm mastery of a being whose life is its own and 
not yours -- and the superior person recognises and appreciates this 
because he too is a free soul whose position is assured, and whose only 
law is his own heritage and aesthetic sense.”</i> - H.P. Lovecraft</p>

		<p>An overview of the circumstances behind this change are available below. If you are interested, please continue reading.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<p>For 6 years, Terraria Tweaker was one of my proudest hobby 
projects. In that long time, I invested some 2000 hours of my life to 
give everyone interested an improved Terraria experience. In 2021, 
Terraria Tweaker came under attack from one of the many destructive, 
degenerate subhumans that have flocked to the internet in the last 
decade. As a humble and niche project, Terraria Tweaker was an easy 
target for the living filth who chose to defame it. It is shocking how 
the abysmal language of a middle-school dropout, a string of unfounded 
misinformation, and insinuating narrative is all it takes to persuade 
the masses. The project's perfect, 6-year track record and my own 
humble-but-respected standing in the Terraria community were no match. 
Surely, the collective IQ of the internet is far below room temperature 
these days. The qualified expert is ignored, deposed, even branded like 
Lucifer with fear-mongering perversions of reality, while the vicious, 
uneducated speculator is regarded as a hero.</p>
		
		<p>Libel should be a serious crime with deserving, harsh punishment. 
However, in the serfdom of the internet, it is not. As such, I will not 
repeat, in any form, the defamation presented by the scum who attacked 
this project, or the mutations thereof created and propogated by the 
morons who believe it. Original research, let alone common sense, is far
 too much for them, and their failures as human beings forced me between
 a rock and hard place when it came to maintaining Terraria Tweaker. 
This is why I have chosen, among no better options, to retire this page.
 Decisions like these are difficult, and often revolve around preserving
 one's livelihood in an unjust situation. In this case, there is also a 
strong, emotional reason.</p>
		
		<p>I have a lot of sentiment for what I do, what I create, and what I 
believe is worth creating. The wrongful destruction of a huge part of 6 
years of my life is painful, to put it lightly, especially since there 
is no viable recourse.</p>
		
		<p>Imagine <i>you</i> spent 2000 hours of your life on a passion 
project. Let's say, building a model plane. Not a tiny RC plane, but a 
beautiful, functioning, flyable, quarter-scale, grand recreation of the 
plane you have always dreamed of piloting. You work on it in the 
mornings before work, during lunch, in the evening, and late into 
weekend nights for 6 years. You proudly display your labor of love in 
your yard and demonstrate it with a big smile on your face to everyone 
who stops by to marvel. One day, a shit-eating knuckle dragger is bored 
and drives his Escalade over it. He then brags about it on reddit, where
 the collective three brain cells of his shit-eating hivemind of 
followers mutates the story to paint your demolished model plane as a 
kamikaze bomb and you as a terrorist.</p>
		
		<p>That's 2000 hours of a hardworking person's life destroyed in 10 
seconds and the unrealized future of their passion project forever 
stolen from them, not to mention the subsequent eternity of defamation. 
Oh, but it's perfectly OK though, because CringeWeebUsername the 
Subhuman had run out of fresh pedo porn on Friday night and <i>needed</i> to find and kill something innocent, lest he suffer the ungodly pain of minor boredom for a whole hour.</p>
		
		<p>This is how Terraria Tweaker died.</p>
		
		<p>It is not the first headstone in the vast graveyard of digital 
murders. So long as the internet permits such conspirators and their 
lunatic followers to act with impunity, it will not be last to die a 
wrongful death.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<p>Addendum A</p>
		
		<p>Terraria Tweaker 2, the application itself, survives the killing of
 the public Terraria Tweaker project. Though the greater internet has 
proven it sees no use in TT2 and would rather torture it for its mere 
existence, I myself am always a primary user of my own software, and it 
has been necessary to update TT2 from time to time in order for my 
friends and I to continue to play Terraria with the tweaks which we have
 long been familiar with. To this effect, at present, I continue to 
maintain the built-in updater service, which has the side effect of 
allowing faithful, honest users to receive these updates. Do not, 
however, this mistake this for a resurrection of the public Terraria 
Tweaker project. The unwashed masses of the internet have made it 
perfectly clear that they possess the intelligence of a rock and are 
utterly incapable of comprehending obvious truths and even more obvious 
lies directly in front of their dumbstruck faces. Restitution and 
justice (or the lack thereof) notwithstanding, putting Terraria Tweaker 
back into the public eye only for it to get massacred again is the most 
foolish thing I could possibly do.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<p>Addendum B</p>
		
		<p>Some small shred of unease has compelled the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198241091852">progenitor</a> of the libel surrounding TT2 (henceforth referred to as <i>Yet Another Unjailed Weeb Pedophile</i>,
 in the spirit of his TCF profile) to remove his original posts, but not
 before allowing them to pollute the internet for two years. During that
 time, and in the ensuing years - and still to this very day! - his lies
 have continuously trended upwards on the search results for Terraria 
Tweaker 2. Three years of the telephone game have cemented the libel 
into the internet's body of knowledge surrounding TT2, especially among 
hiveminds like reddit, where the conspiracy-loving apes and their 
collective three brain cells have pervaded the defamation to a degree 
exponentially more public than <i>Yet Another Unjailed Weeb Pedophile</i>'s
 original posts. New posts from the reddit lemmings now hold the #1 and 
#2 search results for Terraria Tweaker with an iron grip, having long 
displaced the results for the actual history and authority of truthful 
information on TT2 (me and my thread). This is particularly of interest,
 since, after <i>Yet Another Unjailed Weeb Pedophile</i> removed the 
original posts from TCF, he quickly took to reddit to re-introduce his 
libelous narrative into the hivemind, under the guise of a fake "coming 
'clean'" "explanation". Since the apes of reddit <a href="#" onclick="document.getElementById('brainletpic').style.display='block';">happily slurp that up</a><img id="brainletpic" src="/lol/tt2/reddit.png" style="display:none;" width="400px">
 as part of their regular bullshit smoothie, I am unforunately compelled
 to address this development here on this page, being the dirty, 
underhanded deceipt that it is. A killer's pathetic, two-faced 
"remorse", nearly two years overdue after extinguishing an innocent's 
life, does not inexplicably resurrect the slain victim, nor does it heal
 the permanent damage he has caused. Destroying a murder weapon in a 
show of "goodwill" after carrying out murder with it does not magically 
undo the crime, nor does it even remotely equal a sliver of justice. 
Compensate the 2000 hours of my life you stole from me and the 
unrealized future that Terraria Tweaker had before you put a big fucking
 halo on your tiny head.</p>

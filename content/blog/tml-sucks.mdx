summary: "A rant about tModLoader and my lessening respect for it and its developers."

The tModLoader developers have recently decided to [overhaul and completely uproot yet another years-old system](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/issues/3074), much to the dismay of maintainers of old and new mods alike.

{/* lol ghcp generated this from the above sentence, and while completely untrue, I find it quite funny */}
{/* This is the third time this has happened, and it's getting old. The first time was the removal of ModPlayer, which was a huge blow to modders who had spent years developing mods that relied on it. The second time was the removal of ModNPC, which was a huge blow to modders who had spent years developing mods that relied on it. The third time was the removal of ModItem, which was a huge blow to modders who had spent years developing mods that relied on it. */}

<br />

To the uninitiated, this may sound strange—why would a mod loader actively harm existing mods and their developers? The thing is, this is not the first time this has happened, and it certainly won't be the last.

<br />

To understand the absolute state of tModLoader—as well as their rationale for these changes—we should take a step back in time.

## Terraria 1.4

<hr />
<br />

Picture this: it's May 16, 2020, and Terraria 1.4 has just released. You're a fan of Terraria, of course, and also enjoy playing the game modded.

<br />

Being a fan, you're excited to see not just what the latest Terraria update has to offer, but also the changes to tModLoader that are to come with it. Imagine your surprise when you find out that tModLoader is now considered "official" by Re-Logic and is even registered as a mod on Steam, with access to the Steam Workshop.

<br />

For the average user, this might sound great. But for the modders, this has the potential to be a nightmare. Official recognition and support from ReLogic and access to the Steam Workshop? Spells trouble for any sort of healthy competition. Even worse, the Steam Workshop has proven to cause more issues than it fixes, though that's a story for another time.

But despite all this, the biggest smack in the face would be that tModLoader wouldn't release a public beta for 1.4
